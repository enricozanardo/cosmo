"""
We have to implement the following machine learning models that represent a version of the o1-preview model:

The model is called MicroO1 and it has the following capabilities:

- Small and Efficient: MicroO1 is a compact model that requires minimal computational resources.
- Reasoning Capabilities: The model is designed to perform well on reasoning tasks, including question answering and problem solving.
- Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning: The model uses a CoT approach to improve its performance on reasoning tasks.
- PPO-based reinforcement learning: The model uses a PPO-based reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize its parameters.
- Mixed precision training: The model uses mixed precision training to improve its performance and reduce its memory footprint.
- Hardware-specific optimizations: The model has been optimized for specific hardware platforms, including CPUs and GPUs.
- Extended context window: The model can process longer sequences of text than traditional language models.
- Reasoning token processing: The model uses a reasoning token processing approach to improve its performance on reasoning tasks.
- It is optimized for the "openai/gsm8k", "main" dataset.

We have to implement the following modules:

1. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning
2. PPO-based reinforcement learning
3. Mixed precision training
4. Hardware-specific optimizations
5. Extended context window
6. Reasoning token processing 

Therefore the development of the MicroO1 model requires the implementation of the above modules.

Define step by step the development of:

- Input tokenization
- Embedding layer
- Transformer layer (Encoder / Decoder)
- Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning
- PPO-based reinforcement learning (Policy network / Value network)
- Reasoning token processing
- Adaptive Inference
- Output generation
- Extended context window
- Hardware-specific optimizations

Do not write everything at once. Write the code step by step, commenting each part of the code and asking for feedback at each step before continuing to the next one.

Test each part step by step to ensure that it works correctly before continuing to the next one.

PPO-based reinforcement learning components:

- Policy Network (Actor) - Makes decisions about reasoning steps
- Value Network (Critic) - Evaluates the quality of those decisions

Key features of this implementation:
PPO Components:
Reward model for evaluating reasoning quality
Value network (Critic) for estimating state values
PPO loss computation with clipping
Entropy bonus for exploration
Integration with existing model:
Builds on top of CoT transformer
Adds RL-specific forward pass
Maintains compatibility with existing functionality
Comprehensive tests:
Shape verification
Loss computation
Different batch sizes
Reward and value computation
